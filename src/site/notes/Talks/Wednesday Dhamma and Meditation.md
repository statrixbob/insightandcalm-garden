# **20‑Minute Dhamma Talk: Re‑Teaching the Body Its Loveliness**

## **1\. Arriving (1 minute)**

Let’s settle in together. Feel the weight of the body, the breath doing what it does, the ordinariness of sitting here on a Wednesday night. Nothing special. Just bodies being bodies.

Tonight I want to talk about **mindfulness of the body** — *kāyānupassanā* — and how the Buddha invites us to meet this body with patience, humor, and a kind of gentle re‑teaching.

And I want to begin with a poem that is unapologetically about bodies — real bodies, animal bodies, the kind of bodies the Buddha actually meant when he said, “Breathing in, one knows.”

## **2\. The Poem (3 minutes)**

# 

Saint Francis and the Sow

BY [GALWAY KINNELL](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/galway-kinnell)

The bud  

stands for all things,  

even for those things that don’t flower,  

for everything flowers, from within, of self-blessing;     

though sometimes it is necessary  

to reteach a thing its loveliness,  

to put a hand on its brow  

of the flower  

and retell it in words and in touch  

it is lovely  

until it flowers again from within, of self-blessing;     

as Saint Francis  

put his hand on the creased forehead  

of the sow, and told her in words and in touch     

blessings of earth on the sow, and the sow     

began remembering all down her thick length,     

from the earthen snout all the way  

through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail,     

from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine     

down through the great broken heart  

to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering     

from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them:  

the long, perfect loveliness of sow.

Let that settle for a moment — the snout, the spine, the teats, the mouths, the thick length of a living creature. Kinnell does not give us a symbolic sow. He gives us a *body*.

And that’s exactly where the Buddha starts.

## **3\. The Buddha’s First Instruction: Know the Body (2 minutes)**

In the **Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (MN 10)** `https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato` (suttacentral.net in Bing) the Buddha begins with the simplest possible instruction:

> “Breathing in, one knows. Breathing out, one knows.”

Not “breathing in, one perfects.” Not “breathing out, one optimizes.” Just *knows*.

The body is the first foundation because it’s the one thing we can’t escape. Before we have opinions or strategies or spiritual aspirations, we have:

-   breath
    
-   posture
    
-   weight
    
-   warmth
    
-   ache
    
-   aliveness
    

Kinnell’s sow is a perfect companion for this teaching. She is not transcendent. She is not symbolic. She is a creature of mud, slops, milk, and breath.

The Buddha would say: *Yes. Start there.*

## **4\. “Reteach a Thing Its Loveliness” (4 minutes)**

The line that opens the poem’s heart is:

> “…sometimes it is necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness…”

This is not sentimentality. This is **mindfulness**.

Mindfulness of the body is the practice of reteaching the body its loveliness — not by changing it, not by improving it, but by **remembering it**.

And this is where my own body has been a very patient teacher.

## **5\. The Knee Replacement Story (5 minutes)**

After my knee replacements — and the hip, and the cataracts, and whatever else I’ve forgotten — I discovered something the Buddha never mentioned in the suttas:

**Recovery is humbling.**

There’s that moment after surgery when you stand up for the first time and the body says, *“I don’t know how to do this anymore.”*

And the mind says, *“Come on, we’ve been walking since Nixon was in office.”*

And the body says, *“Yes, and now we’re starting over.”*

Physical therapy becomes this slow, awkward process of **re‑teaching the body**:

-   how to bend
    
-   how to bear weight
    
-   how to trust itself again
    

And what actually worked wasn’t pushing or forcing or pretending I was still twenty‑five. What worked was **paying attention** — the same kind of attention Saint Francis gives the sow.

A gentle hand. A little patience. A willingness to meet the body exactly where it was, not where I wished it would be.

**Generosity helped.** Not the dramatic kind — just the small daily generosity of letting the body be slow, letting it wobble, letting it heal on its own timeline.

**Gratitude helped.** Not the Hallmark‑card kind — just noticing the small victories: the first time I stood up without bracing, the first time the joint didn’t complain, the first time I realized I wasn’t thinking about it at all.

And **humor helped more than anything.** There’s nothing like trying to relearn how to walk with dignity while your body is wobbling around like a newborn giraffe. If you can’t laugh at that, you’re in trouble.

But slowly — and never on the day you expect — the body remembers. It stitches together a new way of moving. A new gait. A new rhythm. A new kind of loveliness.

Just like the sow, the body “flowers again from within.”

## **6\. Touch, Contact, and Remembering (3 minutes)**

In the poem, Saint Francis places a hand on the sow’s forehead. This is **phassa** — contact — the root condition for feeling tone.

And the sow “began remembering all down her thick length…”

This is exactly how mindfulness works.

We touch the body with awareness — not to fix it, not to judge it, but to let it remember itself.

The Buddha includes everything in mindfulness of the body:

-   walking
    
-   standing
    
-   bending
    
-   eating
    
-   dressing
    
-   defecating
    

He’s saying: *Your life is happening here. Don’t miss it.*

## **7\. Closing: The Long, Perfect Loveliness (2 minutes)**

The poem ends with the sow remembering “the long, perfect loveliness” of her own body.

Not because it changed. Not because it became ideal. But because someone touched it with attention and said, in effect:

*This too is worthy of knowing.*

This is the heart of kāyānupassanā.

We sit down, we feel the breath, we feel the weight of the body, we feel the warmth, the ache, the pulse, the ordinariness — and we reteach the body its loveliness.

Not by changing it. By remembering it.

If you want, I can now **merge this with the meditation** into a single 40‑minute session, or create a **one‑page outline** you can bring to the cushion.

I like this one too: Love After Love by Derek Walcott Original Language English The time will come when, with elation, you will greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror, and each will smile at the other's welcome, and say, sit here. Eat. You will love again the stranger who was your self. Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart to itself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes, peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your life.

###### Copilot said

That’s a gorgeous choice, Bob — and it sits in the *same constellation* as Kinnell’s sow, but from a different angle. If Kinnell is about **re‑teaching the body its loveliness**, Walcott is about **re‑teaching the self its welcome**.

And the two poems together create a kind of double‑mirror:

-   Kinnell: *“Remember the long, perfect loveliness of the body.”*
    
-   Walcott: *“Greet yourself arriving… you will love again the stranger who was your self.”*
    

Both are invitations to come home to what has always been here.

Both are antidotes to the lifelong habit of ignoring ourselves in favor of some imagined, improved version.

Both are, in their own way, **kāyānupassanā poems** — poems of returning.

### How Walcott fits your talk

If you want to weave *Love After Love* into the same evening, it can serve as the **closing blessing** or the **inner counterpart** to the body‑based work:

-   Kinnell: the body remembering its loveliness
    
-   Walcott: the heart remembering its own welcome
    

You could say something like:

> “If Kinnell teaches us how to touch the body with patience, Walcott teaches us how to touch the self with kindness. One re‑teaches the body its loveliness; the other re‑teaches the heart its home.”

### How it connects to your knee‑replacement story

Your recovery story is already a Walcott poem in motion:

-   You greeted a body arriving at your own door in a new form.
    
-   You had to welcome a stranger who was still you.
    
-   You had to give bread, give wine — generosity, patience, humor.
    
-   You had to peel your own image from the mirror — the image of the body you used to have.
    
-   And you learned to “feast on your life” again, one careful step at a time.
    

It’s all there.

### If you want, I can fold Walcott into the 20‑minute talk

Not as a second poem to read in full — that would be too much text — but as a **closing gesture**, a soft echo, a way of widening the frame from:

-   **body remembering itself** to
    
-   **self remembering itself**
    

If you want that, I can revise the talk so it ends with a Walcott‑shaped blessing, something in your voice that nods to the poem without quoting it outright.

Just say the word and I’ll shape it.

Let's use St Francis/Sow for the talk and the Walcott for the meditation

###### Copilot said

Beautiful — that pairing gives you a clean, elegant arc for the whole evening:

-   **Talk:** Kinnell’s *Saint Francis and the Sow* — earthy, embodied, humorous, patient, about re‑teaching the body its loveliness.
    
-   **Meditation:** Walcott’s *Love After Love* — intimate, gentle, inward, about welcoming the self home.
    

They mirror each other perfectly: **body remembering itself → self remembering itself.**

Below is a fully integrated structure you can use. I’ll keep it in your voice — grounded, lightly amused, ordinary, and dhammic without any performance.

# **20‑Minute Talk (St. Francis / Sow \+ your knee story)**

*(You already have the full talk draft — here’s how to frame it cleanly with the poem.)*

### **Opening**

-   Settle the room.
    
-   Introduce kāyānupassanā as the Buddha’s first foundation.
    
-   Say you want to begin with a poem that is unapologetically about bodies.
    

### **Read the full Kinnell poem**

**\[PASTE FULL TEXT OF “SAINT FRANCIS AND THE SOW” HERE\]**

### **Body as terrain, not identity**

-   The sow is not symbolic; she’s a creature of mud, milk, weight, breath.
    
-   This is exactly where the Buddha starts in MN 10: *“Breathing in, one knows.”*
    

### **“Reteach a thing its loveliness”**

-   This is mindfulness: not fixing, not improving, just remembering.
    
-   Perfect segue into your knee‑replacement story.
    

### **Your story: re‑teaching the body**

-   Recovery was humbling.
    
-   The body didn’t behave the way you remembered.
    
-   The mind wanted to rush; the body said, “Not yet.”
    
-   What worked:
    
    -   paying attention
        
    -   generosity
        
    -   gratitude
        
    -   humor
        
-   The body slowly stitched together a new gait, a new rhythm, a new kind of loveliness.
    

### **Contact and remembering**

-   Saint Francis’ hand on the sow’s forehead \= phassa.
    
-   Mindfulness is that gentle hand.
    
-   The body remembers itself when touched with awareness.
    

### **Closing**

-   The sow remembers “the long, perfect loveliness” of her own body.
    
-   Not because it changed — because it was seen.
    
-   That’s kāyānupassanā.
    

# **20‑Minute Meditation (Walcott as the anchor)**

Here’s a full meditation script that uses *Love After Love* as the quiet heart of the practice. You can read the poem in full because the user (you) provided it.

# [Love After Love](https://allpoetry.com/Love-After-Love)

The time will come   
when, with elation   
you will greet yourself arriving   
at your own door, in your own mirror   
and each will smile at the other's welcome,   
  
and say, sit here. Eat.   
You will love again the stranger who was your self.  
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart   
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you   
  
all your life, whom you ignored   
for another, who knows you by heart.   
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,   
  
the photographs, the desperate notes,   
peel your own image from the mirror.   
Sit. Feast on your life.

## **0:00–1:00 — Settling**

Let the body arrive. Feel the weight, the breath, the ordinariness of sitting here.

No need to improve anything. Just meeting the body as it is.

## **1:00–3:00 — Whole‑body awareness**

Let attention widen to include the whole body. Warmth, pressure, breath, posture.

This is the terrain of practice.

## **3:00–5:00 — Breath in the abdomen**

Feel the abdomen rising and falling. Not deepening the breath. Not shaping it. Just knowing it.

Breathing in, the body knows. Breathing out, the body knows.

## **5:00–7:00 — Contact and patience**

Let awareness rest like a gentle hand — the way Saint Francis touches the sow.

Not fixing. Not judging. Just touching.

Let the body remember itself.

## **7:00–9:00 — Welcoming the self**

Now, gently, bring to mind the Walcott poem.

**\[READ “LOVE AFTER LOVE” HERE\]**

Let the words land without analysis. A poem about greeting yourself at your own door. A poem about welcoming the stranger who has always been you.

## **9:00–12:00 — Greeting yourself**

Let the breath be the doorway. Let the body be the threshold.

Imagine greeting yourself arriving — not the improved version, not the younger version, not the “once I get my act together” version — just the one who’s here.

The one breathing. The one healing. The one wobbling like a newborn giraffe sometimes. The one who keeps showing up.

## **12:00–15:00 — Generosity toward yourself**

Offer yourself the small, daily generosity that helped you through recovery:

-   letting the body be slow
    
-   letting it be awkward
    
-   letting it heal on its own timeline
    

Let that generosity extend inward: *Sit here. Eat. Give back your heart to itself.*

## **15:00–17:00 — Gratitude**

Let yourself feel gratitude for this body — not because it’s perfect, but because it’s yours.

Gratitude for the breath. Gratitude for the joints that work. Gratitude for the ones that have been replaced and re‑taught. Gratitude for the humor that carried you through.

## **17:00–19:00 — Feast on your life**

Let the whole body breathe. Let the whole self be welcomed.

Walcott says, *“Sit. Feast on your life.”*

Let that be the closing gesture: a quiet, inward feast — not indulgence, but recognition.

## **19:00–20:00 — Closing**

Let the attention widen. Feel the body sitting, the breath moving, the room holding you.

A body remembering its loveliness. A self remembering its welcome.

When you’re ready, open the eyes.
