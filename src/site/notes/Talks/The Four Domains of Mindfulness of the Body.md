# 🟫 The Four Domains of Mindfulness of the Body

The Buddha presents kāyānupassanā as the *first* foundation of mindfulness. It’s not preliminary; it’s foundational because the body is where experience becomes undeniable.

## 1\. **Mindfulness of Breathing (ānāpānasati)**

The Buddha begins with the breath because it’s:

-   continuous
    
-   accessible
    
-   embodied
    
-   non‑conceptual
    

The instructions are astonishingly simple:

-   know a long breath as long
    
-   know a short breath as short
    
-   experience the whole body with the breath
    
-   calm the bodily formation
    

No metaphysics. No special states. Just intimacy with breathing as a living process.

This is exactly the way you teach it: breath as motion, breath as physiology, breath as participation.

## 2\. **Mindfulness of Posture**

The Buddha then widens the frame:

-   walking, know you’re walking
    
-   standing, know you’re standing
    
-   sitting, know you’re sitting
    
-   lying down, know you’re lying down
    

This is proprioception as practice — the same “knowing we’re sitting” you naturally guide people into.

## 3\. **Clear Comprehension (sampajañña)**

This is the Buddha’s way of saying:

**Know what you’re doing while you’re doing it.**

He lists everyday actions:

-   bending
    
-   stretching
    
-   eating
    
-   drinking
    
-   dressing
    
-   defecating
    
-   falling asleep
    
-   waking up
    

It’s mindfulness woven into ordinary life, not special meditation.

This is deeply aligned with your lineage’s emphasis on ordinariness and non‑performance.

## 4\. **Contemplation of the Body’s Nature**

This section has several practices, all pointing to the same insight: **the body is not “me” or “mine,” but a changing, contingent process.**

They include:

### • The 32 Parts of the Body

Hair, nails, teeth, skin, organs, fluids — not as disgust, but as de‑romanticization. A way to see the body clearly, without projection.

### • The Four Elements

Earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (temperature), air (movement). This is the part your ecological language harmonizes with beautifully.

### • The Cemetery Contemplations

Not morbid — simply a reminder of impermanence and the body’s natural fate.
