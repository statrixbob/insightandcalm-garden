# **Mindfulness of Breath: A 15‑Minute Teaching Talk (with Timing)**

## **0:00–0:45 — Trauma‑Informed Opening**

Before we begin, I want to name something important. Mindfulness of breath is a beautiful practice, but it isn’t the right doorway for everyone in every moment. If you’re dealing with a cold, asthma, anxiety, or if you’ve lived through trauma that makes the breath feel tight or charged, this teaching may not land for you today — and that’s completely okay.

You’re welcome to listen, and you’re equally welcome to choose a different anchor: sound, touch points, the feeling of your hands or feet, or simply the sense of being here. Breath is just one option among many.

Let’s take a moment to arrive. Feel the body supported. Let the eyes soften.

## **0:45–2:00 — MRI Story: When Breath Isn’t the Right Doorway**

A while back, I was in an MRI tube — the narrow space, the noise, the sense of being slid into a mechanical sandwich. And in that moment, the breath was absolutely *not* my friend. Paying attention to it made everything feel smaller and tighter.

So I didn’t. I used sound instead — the clunks and whirs of the machine — and that was the wiser choice.

That experience taught me something essential: if the breath isn’t available, that’s not a failure. It’s just information. There are many ways to steady the mind.

## **2:00–3:00 — So What** ***Is*** **Mindfulness of Breath?**

When the breath *is* available — when it feels neutral or supportive — it can be a wonderfully ordinary anchor.

In the **Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118)**, the Buddha’s instructions are beautifully simple:

> *“Breathing in long, one knows ‘I breathe in long’; breathing out long, one knows ‘I breathe out long.’”*

Not controlling the breath. Not shaping it. Just knowing it.

Mindfulness of breath is awareness meeting what the body is already doing.

## **3:00–4:15 — The Ordinariness of Breath**

We’ll take somewhere between **600 and 800 million breaths** in a lifetime. What could be more ordinary than that?

And yet, each breath is a quiet act of generosity from the body — automatic, ongoing, shared with every other living being. Not mystical. Not special because it connects us to something transcendent. Special because it connects us to *each other*.

Breath is the most democratic of all experiences.

## **4:15–6:00 — How to Find the Breath**

People sense the breath in different places:

-   the coolness at the nostrils
    
-   the rise and fall of the chest
    
-   the movement of the belly
    
-   the whole body breathing
    
-   or the hand resting gently on the abdomen
    

There’s no correct spot. There’s only the place where the breath is easiest to feel.

## **6:00–8:00 — The Art of Returning**

Most of breath practice isn’t staying with the breath. It’s noticing you’ve left.

That moment — the moment you realize you’re planning dinner or replaying a conversation — is the moment of waking up. That’s the practice.

We return gently, the way you’d guide a puppy:

Sit. Stay. Okay, come back.

No judgment. No drama. Just beginning again.

## **8:00–10:00 — Alternatives When Breath Isn’t Supportive**

If the breath feels tight, charged, or simply unavailable, you can shift to:

-   sound
    
-   touch points
    
-   the weight of the body
    
-   the feeling of the hands or feet
    
-   or the sense of being held by the chair
    

Mindfulness is flexible. Awareness adapts.

This is mettā in practice — choosing what’s kind.

## **10:00–12:00 — Subtlety and Softening**

As the breath becomes quieter, our attention softens. We begin to notice:

-   the beginning, middle, and end of each breath
    
-   the space between breaths
    
-   the body breathing itself
    

We’re not controlling the breath — we’re letting it breathe us. And in that, something opens.

## **12:00–13:00 — Closing Poem**

**“Who Has Seen the Wind?” — Christina Rossetti**

Code

Copy

```
Who has seen the wind?
Neither I nor you:
But when the leaves hang trembling,
The wind is passing through.

Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor I:
But when the trees bow down their heads,
The wind is passing by.
```

## **13:00–15:00 — Closing Reflection**

We don’t have to see the breath. We don’t have to force it. We can simply feel its passing — the body’s quiet gift, moment by moment.

Thank you.
