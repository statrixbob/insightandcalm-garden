Mindfulness of Breath: A 15-Minute Teaching Talk (Draft)

---

**Opening: Trauma-Informed Grounding**

Welcome. As we begin, I want to acknowledge that for some of us, the breath may not always feel like a safe or neutral place to rest attention. If that’s true for you, know that you’re not doing anything wrong. There are other anchors we can use — sound, touch, or the felt sense of the body. You are welcome here exactly as you are.

Let’s begin by arriving. Feel your body in the chair. Let your eyes close or soften. Notice the contact with the ground. Let yourself be held.

**The MRI Story: Discovering the Breath**

I remember lying in an MRI machine once, anxious and claustrophobic. The only thing I could feel was my breath. It became my anchor — not because I was trying to meditate, but because it was the only thing I could feel that wasn’t overwhelming. That’s what we’re exploring today: how the breath can become a place of refuge, a home base for presence.

**The Breath as Ordinary and Sacred**

We breathe 600 to 800 million breaths in a lifetime. Most of them go unnoticed. And yet, each one is a gift — a moment of life arriving. The breath is not special because it’s mystical. It’s special because it’s always here. It’s ordinary. And it’s ours.

**A Teaching from the Buddha: MN 118**

In the Anapanasati Sutta, the Buddha teaches mindfulness of breathing as a complete path to awakening. He begins simply: “Breathing in long, know that you are breathing in long. Breathing out long, know that you are breathing out long.” No need to change the breath. Just feel it. Let the body breathe itself.

**The Monkey Mind and the Art of Returning**

When we begin to pay attention to the breath, we quickly discover the monkey mind — jumping from branch to branch, thought to thought. That’s not a problem. The most important moment in mindfulness of breath is not staying with the breath — it’s the moment you notice you’ve left. That’s the magic moment. That’s the moment of waking up.

**Metta-Infused Framing**

So we return gently. Like training a puppy: “Sit. Stay.” And when it wanders, we don’t scold — we just bring it back. Again and again. With kindness. With patience. With love.

---

**Alternatives to the Breath**

And if the breath isn’t the right anchor for you — that’s okay. You can place a hand on your belly and feel the rise and fall. Or listen to sound. Or feel the contact of your feet on the floor. The point isn’t to force the breath. The point is to find a place where presence can land.

---

**The Art of Attention**

As the breath becomes quieter, our attention softens. We begin to notice the space between breaths. The beginning, middle, and end of each inhale and exhale. We’re not controlling the breath — we’re letting it breathe us. And in that, something opens.

**Closing Poem: “Who Has Seen the Wind?” by Christina Rossetti**

Who has seen the wind?  
Neither I nor you:  
But when the leaves hang trembling,  
The wind is passing through.

Who has seen the wind?  
Neither you nor I:  
But when the trees bow down their heads,  
The wind is passing by.

**Closing Reflection**

We don’t have to see the breath. We don’t have to force it. We can simply feel its passing — the body’s quiet gift, moment by moment. Thank you.
