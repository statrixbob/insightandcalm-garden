# 🌿 **10‑Minute Meditation on Ordinariness**

*A simple, steady arc you can ride in real time*

## **0:00–1:00 — Arrival**

-   Invite everyone to settle into a comfortable posture.
    
-   Name the ordinariness of the moment: “Nothing special happening. Just sitting here together.”
    
-   Acknowledge the everyday sounds, the room, the body as it is.
    

## **1:00–3:00 — Contacting the Ordinary Body**

-   Guide attention to simple sensations: feet on the floor, weight of the body, temperature of the air.
    
-   Emphasize: “This is the body of an ordinary day. Nothing to fix.”
    

## **3:00–6:00 — Breath as the Most Ordinary Thing**

-   Invite awareness of the breath without trying to deepen or improve it.
    
-   “Let the breath be as unremarkable as it wants to be.”
    
-   Highlight the rhythm: rising, falling, beginning again.
    

## **6:00–8:00 — The Beauty of Nothing Special**

-   Gently point out how practice doesn’t require inspiration or intensity.
    
-   “Most of our lives happen in moments just like this.”
    
-   Encourage noticing small, quiet details: a softening in the shoulders, a tiny pause at the end of the exhale.
    

## **8:00–9:30 — Resting in Simple Presence**

-   Let the group sit in silence with the ordinariness of the moment.
    
-   Offer a phrase or two if helpful:
    
    -   “Just this breath.”
        
    -   “Just this moment.”
        
    -   “Nothing special, and that’s enough.”
        

## **9:30–10:00 — Closing**

-   Invite a gentle return to the room.
    
-   “May we meet the ordinary moments of our day with ease.”
    
-   A small bow to the simplicity of the practice.
