## **Twelve Steps in a Theravāda Frame**

### **1\. We acknowledged that craving had overpowered us, and that our lives had become tangled.**

(*taṇhā had the upper hand; dukkha was obvious*)

### **2\. We came to trust that a path of practice could bring steadiness and clarity.**

(*confidence in a workable dhamma, not a deity*)

### **3\. We committed ourselves to living in accordance with the dhamma.**

(*aligning conduct with sīla, not surrendering to a god*)

### **4\. We undertook a thorough investigation of our actions, speech, and intentions.**

(*a sīla–citta inventory, not a moral reckoning*)

### **5\. We acknowledged our unskillful actions to ourselves and to another person.**

(*hiri–ottappa: healthy shame and accountability*)

### **6\. We became willing to abandon unskillful habits of body, speech, and mind.**

(*ready to let go of akusala, not waiting for removal*)

### **7\. With humility, we cultivated new skillful qualities.**

(*bhāvanā: developing kusala states rather than asking for rescue*)

### **8\. We recognized those we had harmed and opened to the possibility of repair.**

(*mettā and accountability meeting in the real world*)

### **9\. We made amends wherever doing so would not cause further harm.**

(*right action, guided by non‑harming — ahiṃsā*)

### **10\. We continued to examine our conduct and corrected unskillfulness promptly.**

(*ongoing sīla practice; daily citta‑checking*)

### **11\. We deepened our practice through meditation and wise intention.**

(*samādhi and paññā: cultivating clarity, steadiness, and discernment*)

### **12\. Having experienced the fruits of practice, we shared the path with others and lived these principles in all areas of life.**

(*dhamma‑dāna and the Eightfold Path expressed everywhere*)
